# 🛒 Online Shopping Cart

## 📌 Project Description
The **Online Shopping Cart** is a Java-based application designed to simulate an online shopping experience. The system allows users to add products to their cart, view items, remove them, calculate the total price, and complete the checkout process. This tool is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure clean, modular, and scalable code.

The project aims to provide a basic simulation of an e-commerce system, focusing on the core features of a shopping cart while applying fundamental OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

## 🎯 Key Features
🔔 **Add Products to Cart**  
   Users can add products to their shopping cart by specifying product details and quantities.

🌐 **Remove Products from Cart**  
   Users can remove products from the cart and update the cart content.

✉️ **Display Cart Items**  
   Displays the list of products currently in the cart, including their details.

🖱️ **Calculate Total Price**  
   Calculates and displays the total price of all the products in the cart.

💾 **Checkout and Clear Cart**  
   After the checkout process, the cart is cleared, simulating the completion of the purchase.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **UI**: Java Swing (for user interface)
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL (optional, for storing cart details in a persistent database)

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Concepts in Use

| Concept        | Application                                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Secure handling of product data and cart information through getters/setters. |
| **Inheritance**   | `ShoppingCart` superclass extended by specific cart functionalities (adding/removing items). |
| **Polymorphism**  | Overloaded and overridden methods for adding and removing products.           |
| **Abstraction**   | Abstract base classes and interfaces to manage product types and cart behaviors. |
